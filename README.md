NeoCafe is an application which eases food ordering process in cafes. Clients easily can look at the menu in-app and order. Orders will automatically will be seen in the waiter app. Booking table in cafe executed through QR code scanner of each table. 

Each design was built in .xml files and connected with adapters so that I can access data or set new values when connect to the backend. Used RecyclerView, CardView, GridLayout, OTP verification, BottomNavigationView, Scanner, and ect. Here are some screenshots of Application:
